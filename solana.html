          <p class="paragraph">I led a comprehensive redesign of Solana’s open source, self-serve NFT platform <span>Metaplex</span>. With a collection of tools, smart contracts, and frontend components, Metaplex allows creators to mint and sell NFTs on the Solana blockchain.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">While gearing up to spin Metaplex into its own company, Solana wanted to rethink the buyer/seller experience of Metaplex and create a more intuitive product base that could be customized by creators who forked the code.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">One of the first things we did was identify moments where we could educate users on the multi-step buying process. Our perspective was antithetical to the common “if you know you know” Web3 product design approach. We introduced strategically placed “how to” buttons throughout the product to guide the buyer through wallet setup, adding funds, placing bids, and&nbsp;more.</p>

This will provide the ability to view price analytics across all of Metaplex in addition to the performance of specific creators and assets.
