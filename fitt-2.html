              <p class="paragraph">In 2018, Fitt was a read-only media site built on Wordpress. The site’s main draw was list-style articles that covered the best local restaurants, gyms, outdoor activities, and fitness events. The content spanned multiple cities and had consistent traffic by way of Google Search.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-block">
              <p class="paragraph">The founders, Joe and Anthony, secured funding to go from media outlet to full digital product. The challenge was to transform Fitt into an all-in-one platform for living a healthy lifestyle. I joined the company to lead design along with my friend Nick who would lead engineering.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">From what I’ve seen, digital product companies tend to start with a niche utility and at some point decide to create content around said utility (articles, videos, Instagrams, etc.). In our case, we were trying to solve the reverse problem. We had popular content, but no utilities that warranted having actual user accounts. You could already read everything on the site—so what was the point of signing up?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-block">
              <p class="paragraph">The assumption was that we could find a way to use the content to drive purchases. For example, you could read about the hot new fitness studio and book a class without leaving Fitt. The idea meant convenience for the user, new sales for the businesses, and positioning Fitt as a consumer-friendly marketplace.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-block">
              <p class="paragraph">My inspiration for how to structure the user experience came from Apple. Around that time, Apple had redesigned their App Store with a content-first approach—articles had become the primary entry point for discovering and downloading apps. If using editorial to drive transactions was working for Apple, it could work for us.</p>
